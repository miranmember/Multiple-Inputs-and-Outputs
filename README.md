# Multiple-Inputs-and-Outputs
This project involves using multiple inputs and outputs with an Arduino board. The project is divided into two parts:

1. Using photo sensors, the brightness of an LED is controlled based on the values read from the sensors.
2. Using a potentiometer, different sounds are produced using an analog output.

## Assumptions
It is assumed that the following hardware is used for this project:
+ Arduino Uno board
+ Photo sensors connected to the Arduino board through analog inputs A0 and A1
+ Potentiometer connected to the Arduino board through analog input A1
+ LED connected to digital output pins 2, 3, 4, and 5
+ Buzzer connected to digital output pin 11
